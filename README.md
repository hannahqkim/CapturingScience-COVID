The recent global pandemic was caused by a common group of viruses – coronaviruses. Although the general public knows the common facts about COVID-19, not many understand the basic biology that drive this disease. My main objectives in building this iPhone application was to (1) build a fun activity that will show the main genes that could be potential drivers for this pandemic, and (2) to help others understand how their mucus samples travel from a nasal swab to a COVID-19 report. 
Viruses attach to a human cell and penetrates the cell’s outer membrane to enter their viral genetic material. They use the host’s DNA building mechanism to replicate their viral components and make more of themselves. In biology, this is called a viral life cycle. The virus that is driving COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2. This specific family of viruses, coronaviruses, have been making news headlines in the past – especially in SARS-CoV– when it caused more than 750 deaths back in 2003. Although the death rate for SARS-CoV is significantly lower than SARS-CoV-2, the fact that there is a virus that we know from the past give scientists the ability to research how the new coronavirus evolved to be so deadly. 
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome sequence contains about 30,000 nucleotide bases in length, and it is about 94.4% similar to the previous SARS-CoV genome. Diving deeper into the specific viral genome, the S gene in SARS-CoV-2 is one of the novel features that differentiates itself from others and, theoretically, the driver of its pathogenicity and transmissibility. Although scientists do not specifically use this S gene to detect COVID-19, they use 3 other genes near the S gene to identify if a person has COVID-19 or not through an experimental method called reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). More information about RT-PCR is given in the iPhone app. 
The iOS application was designed for the general public to search for these 3 genes by moving the slider across the viral genome. A person can choose a random area in the genome and click “check gene” to see if they hit the target gene that scientists look for when running a COVID-19 test. This application was developed through XCode 12, and the background was designed through Adobe Photoshop.
